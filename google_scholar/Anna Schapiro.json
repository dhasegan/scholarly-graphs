What kind of representations support such rapid statistical learning? The medial temporal lobe (MTL) can represent information from even a single experience [4], making it a good candidate system for assisting in initial learning about regularities. We combined anatomical segmentation of the MTL, high-resolution fMRI, and multivariate pattern analysis to identify representations of objects in cortical and hippocampal areas of human MTL, assessing how these representations were shaped by exposure to regularities. Subjects viewed a continuous visual stream containing hidden temporal relationships\u2014pairs of objects that reliably appeared nearby in time. We compared the pattern of blood oxygen level-dependent activity evoked by each object before and after this \u2026",

Anna and I talk about the complementary learning systems framework introduced in 1995 that posits a fast episodic hippopcampal learning system and a slower statistical cortical learning system. We then discuss her work that advances and adds missing pieces to the CLS framework, and explores how sleep and sleep cycles contribute to the process. We also discuss how her work might contribute to AI systems by using multiple types of memory buffers, a little about being a woman in science, and how it\u2019s going with her brand new lab."
