                "abstract": "The neural basis of syntax is a matter of substantial debate. In particular, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), or Broca\u2019s area, has been prominently linked to syntactic processing, but the anterior temporal lobe has been reported to be activated instead of IFG when manipulating the presence of syntactic structure. These findings are difficult to reconcile because they rely on different laboratory tasks which tap into distinct computations, and may only indirectly relate to natural sentence processing. Here we assessed neural correlates of syntactic structure building in natural language comprehension, free from artificial task demands. Subjects passively listened to Alice in Wonderland during functional magnetic resonance imaging and we correlated brain activity with a word-by-word measure of the amount syntactic structure analyzed. Syntactic structure building correlated with activity in the left anterior temporal lobe, but \u2026",

He uses linguistic knowledge at the level of sentence and words, neurocomputational models, and neural data like EEG and fMRI to figure out how we process and understand language while listening to the natural language found in everyday conversations and stories. I also get his take on the current state of natural language processing and other AI advances, and how linguistics, neurolinguistics, and AI can contribute to each other. "
