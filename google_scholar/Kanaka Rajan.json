                "abstract": "Neural network modeling is often concerned with stimulus-driven responses, but most of the activity in the brain is internally generated. Here, we review network models of internally generated activity, focusing on three types of network dynamics: (a) sustained responses to transient stimuli, which provide a model of working memory; (b) oscillatory network activity; and (c) chaotic activity, which models complex patterns of background spiking in cortical and other circuits. We also review propagation of stimulus-driven activity through spontaneously active networks. Exploring these aspects of neural network dynamics is critical for understanding how neural circuits produce cognitive function.",
